Introduction

It is as wrong as it is right to say that blockchain technology is the technology of the future, because the future is today. Especially in a time when online payments are becoming widespread, transparency in daily activities such as food orders is becoming even more important. However, while this technology is so reliable, why is it not widely used and it is thought to be an opportunity to popularize blockchain, starting with young people.
Integrating blockchain technology into cafeteria systems, which is a problem faced by universities, is one of the most feasible solutions that come to mind to popularize this technology. In this way, transparency in food purchases will be ensured and the use of blockchain among university students will be popularized.

University cafeteria systems manage weekly food purchases for a set fee. However, there are some limitations and problems with payments, such as the inability to transfer money between two people, buying food before a certain day, or losing money for food you have not eaten. Payments made using tokens aim to reduce the risk of money being lost by offering a more convenient process. Some of the problems experienced among students will be overcome with the ease of blockchain technology.
In this way, both the dissemination of blockchain technology and transparency in cafeteria systems will be ensured. Each university will be able to manage its own system and the need for external intermediaries, such as banks, will be reduced.

This is our project model:
